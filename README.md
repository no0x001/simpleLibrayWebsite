<h3>Book Library Web App :</h3>

This web application allows users to manage a personal book library. Users can add books to their collection by providing details such as title, author, and the number of pages. The interface is interactive, featuring a responsive design and a visually appealing display of added books. The "Read" checkbox indicates whether a user has read each book, and the books are presented in a card format. The user can easily toggle a modal to input new books with a clean and user-friendly interface. The "Add Book" button triggers the modal, and each book card includes information about the title, author, pages, and a status label. The library display is dynamically updated as books are added, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
